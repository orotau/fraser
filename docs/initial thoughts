Some initial thoughts on the project,

The key idea is to identify phrases.

I am not sure how to do that :-)

First Thought
Identify easy to identify phrases and then see what's left

i.e. do 1 or more passes.

Where to start?
( "i" not followed by "te")

Word frequencies perhaps?

Clear phrase starters
Each phrase is of the form [ pep ] [ nucleus ] [ pop ]

We need a word (or something like "tō mātou") the presence of which **guarantees** we are in the [ pep ]

4 Identifiable possibilities

1 - [ verbal particle ]
2 - [ preposition determiner ]
3 - [ determiner ]
4 - [ preposition ]

The words that we use must **only** be able to be in the preposed periphery. A counter example 'ana' is no good. It can be in both the "pep" and the "pop"
